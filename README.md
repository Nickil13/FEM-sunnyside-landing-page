### What I learned

- Using the picture tag to make images responsive between different media sizes
- Adjusting and centering absolute positioned components
- Changing the colour of images using css filter

### Continued development

I've gotten better with image manipulation since my last FEM project, but I still have lots of room to improve. Sizing, positioning images. Ensuring that important parts aren't cropped off.
